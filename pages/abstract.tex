\textbf{\textit{TODO: KEEP UPDATING ABSTRACT WHILE WRITING}}


This thesis introduces a novel method for the automated annotation of mathematical identifiers in scientific papers, leveraging \ac{LLMs} such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 from OpenAI. The approach addresses the challenges of co-reference resolution and formula grounding, traditionally handled by human annotators through costly and time-intensive procedures. Our study utilises a \ac{MioGatto}, and explores the potential of integrating \ac{POS} tagging and other technologies (like ?) assisting in the process.
The critical component of this research is developing a procedure for generating a dictionary of mathematical identifiers, contextualising their various meanings, and enabling the language model to select the most accurate definition based on the given context. This method demonstrates the impressive capability of LLMs to disambiguate meanings based on context, a vital task due to the inherently polysemous nature of mathematical identifiers.
The preliminary results of 82.36 on a \ac{CoNLL} test set  makes our approach a potential game-changer in mathematical text annotation, significantly reducing time and financial costs.
The findings show the (untapped) potential for using general purpose \ac{LLMs} in specific mathematical language understanding.
